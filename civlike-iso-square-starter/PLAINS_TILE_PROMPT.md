# ChatGPT Prompt for Plains Tile Image

Use this prompt with ChatGPT (or DALL-E) to generate a plains tile image:

---

**Prompt:**

Create a top-down isometric tile texture for a plains/grassland terrain in a strategy game. The image should be:

- **Shape**: A diamond/rhombus shape (isometric tile) centered in the image
- **Dimensions**: 128x64 pixels (or 256x128 for higher quality - it will be scaled down)
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Style**: Pixel art or stylized 2D game art
- **Content**: 
  - Green/yellowish grass texture with natural variation
  - Subtle texture details like small patches of different grass shades
  - Light earth tones visible through the grass
  - No borders or outlines (the game adds those programmatically)
  - The diamond shape should be filled with the grass texture, with transparent corners
- **Color palette**: Warm greens (#8a9a5b is the base color, but use natural variation)
- **Perspective**: Top-down view as if looking down at a flat tile from above at an angle
- **Transparency**: Everything outside the diamond shape should be fully transparent

The final image should look like a single tile that can be seamlessly tiled in an isometric grid. Save it as `tile-plains.png` and place it in the `public/assets/textures/` directory.

**Alternative shorter prompt:**

Generate a 128x64 pixel PNG image of an isometric diamond-shaped plains/grassland tile for a strategy game. The tile should have a green grass texture with natural color variation, be centered in the image with transparent corners, and have a top-down isometric perspective. No borders needed. Style: pixel art or clean 2D game art.
